    <h2>The Journey of a young Culinarian</h2>
    <p>
      Chef Josh began his professional journey in the summer of 2007.  Hailing from Nashville, TN he decided to attend culinary school in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.<br>
      <br>
      After 10 successful years of cooking Chef Josh discovered that he wanted more than what the restaurant industry had to offer.<br>
      <br>
      Through the journey of working in restaurants, catering, yachts, and private cheffing Josh realized it was time to switch gears.<br>
      <br>
      Researching for an ideal industry to jump into was quite a tough ordeal.  Several industries are oversatturated, and generally do not have much to offer in terms of longevity.<br>
      <br>
      One day while browsing Facebook Josh came across an add for Wyncode Academy.  The idea of developing websites, programs, and being equipped to help other business' grow had piqued his interest.<br>

      <br>
      After attending Wyncode's Bootcamp for a day the warm feeling of fellow entreprenuers and tech lovers sparked the desire to learn more.<br>
